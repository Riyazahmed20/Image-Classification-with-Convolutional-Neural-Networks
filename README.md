# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

# Image Classification using PyTorch

## Objective

To develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that classifies images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. This project demonstrates how to load and preprocess image data, build and train a CNN, evaluate model performance, and visualize the results.

## Project Description

Image classification is a core task in computer vision with applications in medical diagnostics, object detection, and facial recognition. This notebook provides a hands-on walkthrough of building an image classifier from scratch using PyTorch.

### üîç Key Features:
- Load image datasets using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`
- Apply data augmentation and normalization with `transforms.Compose`
- Build a custom CNN using `nn.Sequential` or `nn.Module`
- Train and validate the model with mini-batches using `DataLoader`
- Plot training and validation loss curves
- Evaluate model performance on unseen test images
- Display predictions and compare with ground truth

You can customize this notebook easily for:
- Multi-class classification tasks
- Binary classification
- Real-world image datasets
- Transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
