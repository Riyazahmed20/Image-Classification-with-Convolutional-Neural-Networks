# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

## ðŸ§  Objective & Description

This project aims to design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate image classification using TensorFlow/Keras. 
It provides a complete pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics. 
The dataset is organized in a folder-based structure, and the model is trained using image data generators with optional augmentation. 
The notebook is beginner-friendly, modular, and serves as a great foundation for exploring image-based deep learning tasks.
